Most commonly\n * it's used to animate the mounting and unmounting of a component, but can also\n * be used to describe in-place transition states as well.\n *\n * By default the `Transition` component does not alter the behavior of the\n * component it renders, it only tracks \"enter\" and \"exit\" states for the components.\n * It's up to you to give meaning and effect to those states. For example we can\n * add styles to a component when it enters or exits:\n *\n * ```jsx\n * import Transition from 'react-transition-group/Transition';\n *\n * const duration = 300;\n *\n * const defaultStyle = {\n *   transition: `opacity ${duration}ms ease-in-out`,\n *   opacity: 0,\n * }\n *\n * const transitionStyles = {\n *   entering: { opacity: 0 },\n *   entered:  { opacity: 1 },\n * };\n *\n * const Fade = ({ in: inProp }) => (\n *   <Transition in={inProp} timeout={duration}>\n *     {(state) => (\n *       <div style={{\n *         ...defaultStyle,\n *         ...transitionStyles[state]\n *       }}>\n *         I'm a fade Transition!\n *       </div>\n *     )}\n *   </Transition>\n * );\n * ```\n *\n * As noted the `Transition` component doesn't _do_ anything by itself to its child component.\n * What it does do is track transition states over time so you can update the\n * component (such as by adding styles or classes) when it changes states.\n *\n * There are 4 main states a Transition can be in:\n *  - `'entering'`\n *  - `'entered'`\n *  - `'exiting'`\n *  - `'exited'`\n *\n * Transition state is toggled via the `in` prop. When `true` the component begins the\n * \"Enter\" stage. During this stage, the component will shift from its current transition state,\n * to `'entering'` for the duration of the transition and then to the `'entered'` stage once\n * it's complete. Let's take the following example:\n *\n * ```jsx\n * state = { in: false };\n *\n * toggleEnterState = () => {\n *   this.setState({ in: true });\n * }\n *\n * render() {\n *   return (\n *     <div>\n *       <Transition in={this.state.in} timeout={500} />\n *       <button onClick={this.toggleEnterState}>Click to Enter</button>\n *     </div>\n *   );\n * }\n * ```\n *\n * When the button is clicked the component will shift to the `'entering'` state and\n * stay there for 500ms (the value of `timeout`) before it finally switches to `'entered'`.\n *\n * When `in` is `false` the same thing happens except the state moves from `'exiting'` to `'exited'`.\n *\n * ## Timing\n *\n * Timing is often the trickiest part of animation, mistakes can result in slight delays\n * that are hard to pin down. A common example is when you want to add an exit transition,\n * you should set the desired final styles when the state is `'exiting'`. That's when the\n * transition to those styles will start and, if you matched the `timeout` prop with the\n * CSS Transition duration, it will end exactly when the state changes to `'exited'`.\n *\n * > **Note**: For simpler transitions the `Transition` component might be enough, but\n * > take into account that it's platform-agnostic, while the `CSSTransition` component\n * > [forces reflows](https://github.com/reactjs/react-transition-group/blob/5007303e729a74be66a21c3e2205e4916821524b/src/CSSTransition.js#L208-L215)\n * > in order to make more complex transitions more predictable. For example, even though\n * > classes `example-enter` and `example-enter-active` are applied immediately one after\n * > another, you can still transition from one to the other because of the forced reflow\n * > (read [this issue](https://github.com/reactjs/react-transition-group/issues/159#issuecomment-322761171)\n * > for more info).

This\n// implementation also provides for initalizing the generator with\n// string seeds, or for saving and restoring the state of the generator.\n//\n// On Chrome, this prng benchmarks about 2.1 times slower than\n// Javascript's built-in Math.random().\n\n(function(global, module, define) {\n\nfunction XorGen(seed) {\n  var me = this;\n\n  // Set up generator function.\n  me.next = function() {\n    var w = me.w,\n        X = me.X, i = me.i, t, v;\n    // Update Weyl generator.\n    me.w = w = (w + 0x61c88647) | 0;\n    // Update xor generator.\n    v = X[(i + 34) & 127];\n    t = X[i = ((i + 1) & 127)];\n    v ^= v << 13;\n    t ^= t << 17;\n    v ^= v >>> 15;\n    t ^= t >>> 12;\n    // Update Xor generator array state.\n    v = X[i] = v ^ t;\n    me.i = i;\n    // Result is the combination.\n    return (v + (w ^ (w >>> 16))) | 0;\n  };\n\n  function init(me, seed) {\n    var t, v, i, j, w, X = [], limit = 128;\n    if (seed === (seed | 0)) {\n      // Numeric seeds initialize v, which is used to generates X.\n      v = seed;\n      seed = null;\n    } else {\n      // String seeds are mixed into v and X one character at a time.\n      seed = seed + '\\0';\n      v = 0;\n      limit = Math.max(limit, seed.length);\n    }\n    // Initialize circular array and weyl value.\n    for (i = 0, j = -32; j < limit; ++j) {\n      // Put the unicode characters into the array, and shuffle them.\n      if (seed) v ^= seed.charCodeAt((j + 32) % seed.length);\n      // After 32 shuffles, take v as the starting w value.\n      if (j === 0) w = v;\n      v ^= v << 10;\n      v ^= v >>> 15;\n      v ^= v << 4;\n      v ^= v >>> 13;\n      if (j >= 0) {\n        w = (w + 0x61c88647) | 0;     // Weyl.\n        t = (X[j & 127] ^= (v + w));  // Combine xor and weyl to init array.\n        i = (0 == t) ? i + 1 : 0;     // Count zeroes.\n      }\n    }\n    // We have detected all zeroes; make the key nonzero.\n    if (i >= 128) {\n      X[(seed && seed.length || 0) & 127] = -1;\n    }\n    // Run the generator 512 times to further mix the state before using it.\n    // Factoring this as a function slows the main generator, so it is just\n    // unrolled here.
